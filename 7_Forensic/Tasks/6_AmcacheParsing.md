Files in question (details only provided for funnycatmeme): 
- C:\users\r-win10\downloads\funnycatmeme.exe
    - SHA1  starts with: "e8"
    - Product name: "apache http server"
    - Link Date: "2009-05-26 11:57:51"
- c:\users\r-win10\downloads\shell.exe 
    - SHA1, Link Date, product name is the same as for "funnycatmeme.exe" 

Maybe shell.exe was renamed to funnycatmeme.exe. Since hash is the same, the content is almost certainly the same too. 

**Other notes**
There seem to be some strange empty lines. Not sure if this is normal for the format or also an indicator of something being wrong.
