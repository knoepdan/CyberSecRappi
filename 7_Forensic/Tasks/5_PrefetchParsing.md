Some candidates: 
- \WINDOWS\SOFTWAREDISTRIBUTION\DOWNLOAD\INSTALL\AM_DELTA.EXE  15:53:32 (probably ok around google/edge update)
- \USERS\R-WIN10\DESKTOP\SYSINTERNALS\PSEXEC64.EXE  15:56:02 
    - powershell related
- \USERS\R-WIN10\DOWNLOADS\FUNNYCATMEM.EXE  18:39:30
    - before: its \WINDOWS\CONSENT.EXE was acalled
    - afterwards: some activity regarding powershell console ()

It more or less matches with the information of the employee regarding when infection actually started. The user probably had to give consent to whether he was allowed to run the application. Afterwards with see some powershell activity which could be related.
