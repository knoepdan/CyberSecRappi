# Vulnerability



### phases

1. Discovery
2. Exploit  -> a "secret" exploit is available
3. Disclosure
4. Patch Release
5. Patch Installation


### what is our respnsibility
- examples: 
  - run stuff in VM, virtual machines etc.
  - pen testing.. reducce attack surface
  - patch process: reduce time to install/roll out patches


### Classification Vulnerabilities (Standards)
- CVE   (managed by MITRE)
  - request CVE via https://cve.mitre.org
    - process see powerpoint + docment in github repo 
  - CVSS2 score (obsolete, stopped mid 2022)
  - CVSS3 score
  - CVE Entry of a vulnerability will be assigned a CVSS3 score and a CWE 
- CWE  Common Weakness Enumeration  (also managed by MITRE)
  - example: Cross site scripting
- ASVS   (managed OWASP, another standard )
  - intended mainly for developers
  - ASVS -> basically a list of recommendations
    - ASVS level 1: recommendation for all apps (example: encoding)
    - ASVS level 2: 
    - ASVS level 3: for high security applications (e.g. nuclear plant)
- OWASP TOP 10  https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/
  - lists 10 most commen vulnerabilities (not the same as ASVS but both are managed by )
  

*Some other definition: CVE is a standard for identifying and naming specific vulnerabilities, while CWE is a standard for classifying and describing the types of weaknesses that can lead to vulnerabilities*


### Websites
- national vulnerability database (check:  https://nvd.nist.gov/ )
- https://cve.mitre.org   ( https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html )
- https://cvedetails.com/cwe-definitions.php
- other websites...


### varia
- Bug bounty -> usually companies pay money for a found bug
- C&C: Command and control
- C2 server:   6 levels (last level is when attacker actually enter/executes his command


)
