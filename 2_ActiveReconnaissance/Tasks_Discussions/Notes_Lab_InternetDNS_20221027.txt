## DNS Stuff
Zonentransfer: 
Dump of all the hosts in a DNS (often not allowed)

1. dig ns compass-security.com  (get nameserver)
2. dig -t axfr  @ns1.compass-security.com  compass-security.com

Root Nameserver -> hardcoded in nameserver

## DNS over HTTP
(in diagram: DOH = DNS over HTTP) 
DNS tunneling is possible...

DNS can be abuse as reverse shell.  (also works over DNS over HTTP)


Example: 
https://bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/


## varia
- tool proxychains -> can be used to proxy requests. (Using SOCKS5 proxy which can tunnel any TCP protocol)

- curl via proxy
-- "curl -x 10.4.204.2:8080 http://someDomain.ch/ -k -I"  -> proxy will have to make a dns request 
-- "curl -x 10.4.204.2:8080 http://0x01.asdfasdfasdfsdf-dtt.csnc.ch/ -k -I"  -> will also make a dns request even though domain is nonsense


## examens
Recommendations for exam: 
- use simple tools: DNS over enum  (maybe not Maltego as it returns too much)
