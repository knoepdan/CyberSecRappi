### Serialization

Task was to play around with serialization using PHP and JAVA. 
Finding is basically that serialized data is not to be considered encrypted or somehow sure data. It can be changed when accessible. 

**php**
format is binary but can look a bit like json if only asci characters are present
Deserialize:  There seems to be a function "unserialize" which takes a string a sthe first argument
Serialize: function "serialize"
