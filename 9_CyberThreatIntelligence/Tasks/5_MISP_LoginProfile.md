## MISP  framework 
Information could also be entered in an excel but with MISP we can: a) have a tool that is targeted at indicators of compromise and allows easy sharing. 

MISP has - as far as I understand - the following main entities:
- Event
    - Event is an occurence of an cyber security incident
    - consists of Objects and Attributes (and probably can also contain Galaxies)
- Object of an event -> (mainly used in exercise)
    - can easily be connected to other objects (for graph)
    - Model: attackers, vicitms, vulnerabilities etc. with objects
- Attribute of an event 
    - connection for
- Galaxy
    - ??? not used

A lot is up to the user on how he/she wants to model it. Example: Sometimes add an information as object or as attribute.
