# SANS 2021 CTI Survey


0. Where does my organization it in?
    - Dormakaba -> Technology
    - Size: Medium
1. Wo are stakeholders you can identify now?
    - Riskmanagement
    - IT
        - SOC (security operations center)
        - Incident response team (IR)
        - probably all IT departments 
    - Development & research department(s) which deliver IT products
2. Where would you put your CTI team?
    - Not so easy to answer because: 
        - I don't know the current structure (IT is partially managed in India as far as I know but we also have a local IT)
        - Whe have our own IT but we also develop software ourselves which poses 2 problems:
            - software developers often need admin rights which is riskier
            - Our own software should be secure as well 
        - Answer: still not sure.. maybe near or part of risk management but close ties to the IT infrastructure but should also be able to give recommendations to development & research departemnts (and influence recommendations)
3. By how many points did the amount of organisations, which consume or produce CTI, increase between 2019 and 2021?
    - 2019: 71.6%
    - 2021: 85.0%
    - Diff: 13.4% (assuming sample size stayed the same)

6. What kind of information will be the least useful to stakeholders in the next 12 months?
    - "Specific IoCs to plug into IT and security infrastructure to block or find attacks"
7. What is the percentage of survey responders not participating in an ISAC?
