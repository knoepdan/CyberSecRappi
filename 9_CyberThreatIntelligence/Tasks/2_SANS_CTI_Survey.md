    - Size: Medium
    - 
- Wo are stakeholders you can identify now?
- Where would you put your CTI team?
    - Not so easy to answer because: 
        - I don't know the current structure (some might be outsourced or at least in abroad?)
        - Whe have our own IT but we also develop software ourselves which poses 2 problems:
            - software developers often need admin rights which is riskier
            - Our own software should be secure as well 
        - Answer: still not sure.. maybe near or part of risk management
