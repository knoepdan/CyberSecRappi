## Introduction
A threat intelligence platform (TTP) for gathering, sharing, storing and correlating Indicators of Compromise of targeted attacks, threat intelligence, financial fraud information, vulnerability information or even counter-terrorism information

There are multiple instances of MISP. Information sharing among instances can be controlled (as far as I know). See also "Information sharing: Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)" 



## Support for frameworks/standards

- Supports import from STIX files
