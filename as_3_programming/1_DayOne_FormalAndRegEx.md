**2.1.2 Morgan's Law**

- !(A and !(B or !C) or D)
    - !(A and !B and C or D)
        - Solution: !A or B or !C and !D   
- !(!(!A and B) and !(C or !D))
    - !(A or !B and !C and D)
        - Solution: !A and B or C or D
- A or (C and !(B or C))
    - A or C and (!B and !C)
        - Solution:  A or C and !B and !C    (will always reflect the value of A)


**2.1.3 Simplify expression**
- A and (!A and B)
    - Solution: false
- A and (!A or B)
    - Solution: A and B

    - Solution A xor B
- (A or !B) and (!A or B)
    - Solution: A and B
- !(A and !B) or (A and !B)
    - !A or B or A and !B
        Solution: A and !B


**2.2.1.1 Control structures conditions**

```
if(customer.hasKid){
    if(customer.kid.age < 5){
        show(bunnies);
    }else if(customer.kid.age <= 10){
        show(mice)
    }else{
        // we could move the condition into the else but to clarify that we test a different property check conditions within the sle block
        if(customer.kid.gender == f){
            show(rats)
        }else{
            show(kitten);
        }
    }
}else if(custom.IsAlone){
    show(puppies);
}else{
    show(fish)
}
```

**2.2.1.2 Control structures case matching**

           Check type of animals
            /                   \
        fish                   rodent
       /     \               /     | \
    tropical  \            rat     |  mice 
            goldfish               |   
                                  hamster

Decision tree has 2 laysers, which makes just one switch statement unsuiteable. Pseudo code reflects these 2 layers
```
switch(animal family)
    case(rodents){
        switch(species){
            case(rat): feed(nuts, meat)
            case(hamster): feed(grain)
            case(mice): feed(nuts)
        }
    }
    case(fish){
       if(fish.isTropical  == true){
          feed(dry food);
       } else if(fish.isGoldfish){
          feed(frozen food);
       }
    }
```


**2.2.1.3 Control structures loops**


Diagram (maybe not the best decision to not use a drawing tool)

    Start loop

    --------------
    | get item   |
    --------------
       |
       /\
      /  \
      \  / is parcel
       \/\
       |  \ yes
    no |   \
       |   -------------
       |   | send left |
       |   -------------
       |              |
    --------------    |
    | send right |    |
    --------------    /
      |              /
      |     _ _ _ _ /    
      /\  / 
     /  \/
     \  / items left
      \/

     End loop

```
loop{
    var item = getNextItem(); // in "real" code, i would probably do something like "while(itemList.next != null))...."
    if(item.isParcel){
        send(item, right);
    }
    else{
        send(item, left);
    }
    if(!hasMoreItems()){
        exit loop
    }
}

```
**2.2.2.1 Constants and variables**

Not sure i moved, I understood how to shorten code execution.
Did the following things: 
- moved the first multiplication in the variable assignments (would break edge case when input is 1)
- skipped one loop round by already exiting the loop when counter is 2 (as multiplying with one makes no sense)
- reversed the counter order (decrementing instead of incrementing). Should have no influence
```
var result= input * input-1;
var counter = input-2;
loop
	result = result * counter;
	if(counter =< 2){
		exit loop;
	}
	counter = counter -1;
end loop

```

**2.2.2.2 arrays**
```
const input = [2, 3,4]; // random array
var result = 0;
var counter = 0; 
loop
    result = result + input[counter];
    counter++;
end loop
```

**2.2.2.3 map**

```
const input = [];
const corners = {
    "Triangle": 3,
    "Rectangle": 4,
    "Pentagon": 5
    "Hexagon": 6  
}
var counter = 0;
Loop
    var key,value = corners[counter];
    input[counter] = value; // assuming this works (some languages would throw an ex as array are defined as fixex)
    counter++;
End loop
```
Usually, it is possible to iterate over the entries in a map/dic, but quite possible the idea was to access the map values explicitly via key. Example: `corners["Pentagon"]`

- not sure if I understand the exercise at all:-( 
    - add the numbers INTO an array? (creating the array?...assuming it is not a fixed size array)
    - create the sum of the nof corners passed as an array (where is the map?)? 
    - where 


**2.2.3.1 methods**

```
// to be called like: sum([1,2,3,4,5])
method sum = (input : []) => { // method as we want a return value
    var result = 0;
    var counter = 0; 
    loop
        result = result + input[counter];
        counter++;
    end loopÂ¨
    return result;
}
// combine
const array = [3, 4];
const calculatedSum = sum(array); // 7
const factorialSum = calculateFactorial(calculatedSum);

// user input
const userInput : number // assuming dataType is number (otherwise we would have to convert the user input)
const factorialSum = calculateFactorial(userInput);

```


## Regular expressions
Remark: tested using PCRE2 from https://regex101.com/ 
(Could be that sometimes the "/" as prefix and suffix is missing as this is not required by regex101)

**3.1.1 Literal matching**
Text: "This is nice little text"
Search for "nice" using regex:  `/nice/`

Problem: this would match false positives such as nicer or it would not match "Nice". We cannot use " " (`/ nice /`) cause we would not find all "nice" (for example when in brackets, end of sentence, line break etc.)

**3.1.2 Alternatives**
Regex:  `/if|then|else/`
I didn't find any false positives (unwanted matches) with code from the formal languages chapter. However, regex would match words like "lift", "elsewhere" etc. 

**3.1.3 Word boundaries**
Regex:  `/\bif\b|\bthen\b|\belse\b/`

**3.1.4 White space**
`/\sif\s/` would not find an if at the beginning of a text

**3.1.5 Character classes**
Regex for nit, wit, kit, lit:  `/[nwkl]it/`  (or  `/\b[nwkl]it\b/` with  word boundaries)
Regex for Aloof, aloof, AlooF, alooF:  `/[Aa]loo[fF]/`

**3.1.6 Quantifiers**
Task: "?", "+" "*" using between m and n notation

- "?": `{0,1}`
- "+": `{1,}`
- "*": `{0,}`

**3.1.7 Wildcard**
`/\b[0-9]+\s.+\b/` -> matches: "23 pigs" or "3323 turtles"

**3.1.8 Negation**
`[^0-9]*` -> anything except lower case characters
`[^a-z]*` -> anything except lower case characters

Remark: in the concept the caret is outside of the brackets. Shouldnt it be inside?

**3.1.9 Escaping characters**
`true \/ false`
`price \[EUR\]`
