# Important tools

## General

- https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ various helpful stuff
- https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/
  - various cheatsheets
- Mitre attack framework
  - https://attack.mitre.org/

## Network general

**netcat**

- network tool for tcp/udp connections (can be used for reverse shells)
- `while true; do cat http_response.txt | nc -l 8000; done`
  - create a simple webserver returning what is in the file http_response.txt
- https://www.kali.org/tools/netcat/
- https://www.varonis.com/blog/netcat-commands

**DNS tools and commands**

- https://www.whatsmydns.net/ -> website to check dns
- dig (alternative to nslookup)
  - `dig www.ost.ch` - get dns entry
  - `dig @8.8.8.8 www.ost.ch` -> via google dns server
  - `dig ns ost.ch` -> name server lookup (returns the name servers (authorative name servers))
  - `dig mx ost.ch` mail server lookup
  - `dig -x 146.136.105.52` -> reverse lookup ip to domain name
    - via website: https://www.reverseip.ch/en/ 
  - `dig ost.ch ANY +short +trace` trace (more see pdf)
- DNS over http
  - `curl -s -H 'accept: application/dns-json' 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=ost.ch&type=A' | jq .`
    - (there are other dns over http servers as well..e.g. from google)
  - dns-over-https-docker
    - https://github.com/ibuetler/dns-over-https-docker.git
    - see lab task Reconnaissance 
- FPDNS - determine version (and implementations) of dns server
  - `fpdns ost.ch`
  - https://manpages.org/fpdns
- DNS spoofing
  - hosts file (linux: "/etc/hosts") -> most simple (just works locally)
  - "dnsmasq" -> see assignment network 1/2 -> "A1 Kookarai: dnsmasq" | "6_DNS_SpoofingAnswers.md"
- various other tools (possibly improve)
  - `host 146.136.105.52` -> reverse lookup, ip to host (there are other tools for this as well.. dig, even nmap can be used for this)
  - `fierce -dns ost.ch` DNS brute forcing (my understanding, will try to get all dns entries).. reconaissance tools also for enumeration
  - sublist3r `python3 /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/sublist3r.py -d google.com` (maybe full path can be omited) - DNS enumeration
  - subfinder `subfinder -d compass-security.com` - DNS enumeration
  - amass `amass enum -d compass-security.com`
  - dnsenum: `dnsenum --noreverse -o result.xml compass-security.ch` -> will also find mailservers etc.
  - dnscan -> scan for subdomains (via list, attention: active scanning, should be preinstalled)`
    - see lab tasks and also my recap
  - dnscan -> scans for subdomains and non-contiguous IP blocks.
    - see lab tasks and also my recap

**WhoIs**
WHOIS is a public database that houses the information collected when someone registers a domain name or updates their DNS settings.
  - Linux tool "whois":  
    - `whois -h riswhois.ripe.net -- '80.254.178.110'` (single ip)
    - `whois -h riswhois.ripe.net -- '-m 193/19'` (ip mask)
  - Online tool: https://stat.ripe.net/ 
  - search for .ch and .li domains: https://www.nic.ch/whois/
  - search for .com domains: https://lookup.icann.org/lookup

**various**

- `netstat -antp` check port and interface of services (or without -antp)
- SSH
  - `ssh -l hacker -p 4444 localhost`
  - Possible to authenticate via private/public key (SSH Public Key Auth). 
    - Generate key: `ssh-keygen` (and then probybly to copy via "ssh-copy-id", see lab-task)
  - lab task for man-in-the-middle via ssh:  https://github.com/Hacking-Lab/alpine-ssh-mitm-legacy.git

- Trace IP packages
  - windows: `tracert.exe hsr.hacking-lab.com` (default using ICMP)
    - `traceroute -M icmp www.compass-security.com` -> run it using ICMP (works when ICMP doesnt block )
    - `traceroute -M tcp -p 443 www.compass-security.com` -> run it using tcp (needs a listening port, here 443)
  - linux: `traceroute www.compass-security.com` (default using udp)
- IANA: https://www.iana.org/  (global coordination for DNS root, IP addressing etc.)
- Certificate transparency: Standard for monitoring + auditing the issuance of digital certificates.
  - https://crt.sh/

## Reconassaince, Vulnerability etc

### Maltego  
Passive reconaissance (and maybe partly active as well??)
-> see separate md file

### NMAP
Port scanner (and a little more)
https://nmap.org/book/man.html (manual)
-> see separate md file

### Nessus
Vulnerability scanner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfT_qEw3Fcs
-> see labtask "Reconaissance/Nessus Vulnerability Scanner" or "Gaining Access/Metasploitable VM" where we find vulnerability with nexus to be then exploited via Metasploit"

### fail2ban
Tool against password-spraying. (trying same pw with different users.)
Will block IP's that have too many failed logins.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkeb0pWYDr8


## Run attacks

### Metasploit  (all kind of things)
metasploit can be used to:
- create trojan horses
- run attacks
- contains payload generator (msfvenom)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBAC5UfalC8
https://docs.metasploit.com

->see separate file

### Goship (run pishing attacks)
https://github.com/ibuetler/gophish.git  (runs via docker, see man-in-the-middle lab tasks)
Allows to configure mails to be sent to people (user and groups) which have a link to a target page.  Goship provides templates etc. (also contains Mailcatcher to overview mails)


### Bettercap (man in the middle)
Tool that can be used for Man in the middle attacks (arp spoofing.. probably has more features) https://www.bettercap.org/
->see separate file

### Password sprying  (password spraying)
run: `SharpSpray.exe --Passwords Winter2020 --Sleep 15 --Delay 300`
see lateral movment "06B Lateral Movement.pdf"

### Scapy
scapy: tool (fake/forge packages/requests, e.g. dns spoofing)  (see man-in-the-middle powerpoint)
for man-in-the-middle

### Heartleach
Exploits heartbleed bug (https://heartbleed.com/) and is more relyable than the same exploit in Metasploit. Install if needed: `sudo apt-get install hl-heartleech`
`/opt/applic/heartleech/heartleech --scan heartbleed.vm.vuln.land --autopwn --threads 20`
*Might have to run more than once for a successful exploit. Supposed to be more reliable than metasploit but cannot confirm this*
-> see "Gaining Access/Heartbleed OpenSSL"
