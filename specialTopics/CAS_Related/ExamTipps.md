### 7 Forensics

- Timesketch 
    - see lab 8

*Remark: see also notes in corresponding folder*

### 9 Cyber Threat Intelligence
There will probably be 
- a quiz 
    - questions about a Mitre Att&ck framework (where to place what)
- RFI (Request for intelligence)
    - like lab 8

### 10 Malware analysis
- Deobfuscation of VB in office files
    - Linux tools  (also see assignment)
        - Oletools to extract code (without running it)
            - use extracted code as base for further deobfuscation
        - ViperMonkey: automated deobfuscation (using Oletools internaly)
            - (it seems you can only run it once.. so maybe clone git repo)
            - check results, also check what what actions were deteced
    - Copy extracted code and start further deobfuscation (best in a git repo)
        - also use excel/word to execute snippets (attention: be careful not to actually execute malware)
- Ghidra
    - only static analysis: will be 32bit + windows
    - maybe good exercises: https://crackmes.one/ 

### 13 Forensic readiness
- EQL
