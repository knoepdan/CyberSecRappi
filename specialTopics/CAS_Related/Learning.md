## Basic plan and goals
To repeat: 
- Crypto
- Network
- Web (basics as a) I know most of it and b) will be repeated later
- Code
    - bash + python for usage with any kind of tool
    - C + assembly for reverse engineering
- Labs in order of teaching
    1. Passive reconnaisance
    2. active reconnaisance
    3. etc..


To prepare todo
- some code/examples to easily switch from: 
    - bash to python (and vica versa of course) 
    - Potentially also same for  .Net
        - especially on windows: powsershell to .Net
    - also javascript (node) to bash (and indirectly python)
- Improve tools markup file 
    - goal should be a more or less complete list of important tools
- VM's
    - backups + snapshots
    - clean LiveCD (+ the used LiveCD)
    - Windows CD with all tools
- Leftovers
    - identify weak points and write them down



### Dates
Last lesson: 7. July 
Expected end of last lab: 21. July 2023  
Test: around 20. of August 2023
