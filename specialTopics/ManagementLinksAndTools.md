# Management links and tools

*Remark: there is some overlap with tools and links that are more technical.*


**CVE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures**
- https://www.cve.org/
    - Specific vulnerabilities (product related)
    - search: https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html
        - Attention: might be moved to a new site soon (15.8.2023)
    - https://cve.mitre.org  (potentially old site)
**CWE Common Weakness enumeration**
