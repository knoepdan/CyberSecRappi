**DNS Mask**
Google name server cannot be used in some companies
-> DNS protocol 
...
- Active Directory in company is DNS server in some companies
- in some companies Active directory is not allowed to resolve urls
    -  proxy needs to resolve url.. 
    - .. not fully clear.

    "DNS over HTTP"  .. might be the default at some point in the future...

**Traceroute needs to be run as root**
- necessary for some commands as they might change packages
    - https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/traceroute-tracepath-network-troubleshooting
 

    TraceRoute seems to be working better on "real" server (Possible explanation: VM Ware driver might not let some packages through)

- in Linux.. for lower port numbers one needs root permissions


**IDS Intrusion Detection System**



**Mac OS (probably not relevant for me)**
