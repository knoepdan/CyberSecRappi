# Mail SPF, DKIM, DMARC

### Answers


- has opportunistic encryption being used?
    - Answer: Compass to HSR (not sure though... but it seems to me that am encrypted connection was used to send the mail but CA could not be verified) 
- is the smtp communication using spf protection?
    - yes.. see excel
- is the smtp communication using dkim protection?
    - yes.. (see mail headers and server logs.) Also see excel
- is the smtp communication using dmarc protection?
    - generally yes (except Compass to HSR where I didn't find any info)

### Checks

**CHECK SPS**
1. Check if sender has SPS info 
    - e.g.: `dig -t txt hsr.ch +noall +answer`  (hsr.ch is domain from from email)
        - answer with SPF: "v=spf1 mx a:sismtp01.ost.ch ip6:2001:620:130:a036::18 ip6:2001:620:130:a036::19 ip4:152.96.21.228 ip4:152.96.21.229 ip4:152.96.36.18 ip4:152.96.36.19 -all"
            - this does just mean that in this example: hsr provides the info for the receiveer to check SPF. It is still up to the receiver to check.
2. Check mail header for X-Spamd-Result: it seems here the checks are visible. 

**CHECK DKIM**
1. In mail header look for DKIM-Signature. Look for s entry (Example: "s=hsr119).  -> see text or via https://mha.azurewebsites.net/ 
2. dig query: `dig +short hsr1119._domainkey.hsr.ch txt`
    - alternativly use DKIM loop via https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx (e.g.: "hsr.ch:hsr1119")
3. With DKIM-Signature in mail and (public) key in DNS entry, it is possible to verify email 
4. Check if DKIM-Signature was verified: 
    - see server logs of receiver
    - see mail header X-Spamd-Result

**CHECK DMARC**
1. Check if there is a DNS entry: 
    - `dig -t txt _dmarc.hsr.ch +short`  (hsr.ch has no DMARC entry)
    - Alternativly:  https://mxtoolbox.com/DMARC.aspx  
https://mxtoolbox.com
2. Check mail header for X-Spamd-Result: it seems here the checks are visible. (probably relevant here) 

### Notes

- **HSR to compass (1 mail)**
    - Outlook msg -> see png or header.txt (no need to check *.msg file https://emailheaders.net/outlook.html )
    - Mail + Header:  https://mha.azurewebsites.net/  
        - hsr to compass
    - Traffic (Wireshark *.pcap file)
        - encrypted: Server certificate from HSR
            - 152.96.36.18 mx1.hsr.ch
            - mx1.compass-security.com
    - logs
        - DKIM successful
Findings: 
- HSR has no DMARC entry -> DNS query via https://mxtoolbox.com/DMARC.aspxÂ¨
- HSR has SPF entry (dig -t txt hsr.ch or also via mxtoolbox.com) and 152.96.36.19 is allowed to send
    -  I don't see this verified in the logs, so I guess compass doesn't have SPF checks
- HSR has DKIM which was used here


**Hacking-Lab to Compass**
- DKIM used and verified
- Hacking-lab has DMARC and SPF entry
    - but i cannot see SPF entry verified in logs (and if no checks fails, DMARC is not relevant)
- from my understanding, the connection between hacking-lab and compass was not encrypted, but the compass receiving server would forward the mail via TLS to another internal mail server. 

**gmail to Compass**
gmail has: SPF, DKIM and DMARC entries. 
- DKIM check was successful according to logs


**compass to hsr**
We only got the logs of the sender. 
SPF pass visible in log. 

**Generally**
Mail header: each mail server usually adds information to the header. Usually adds "Received" (and other stuff). Existing headers, are usually not changed, but can be over/rewritten (X-Envelope...).
