What is Forensic readiness: 
- organizational and technical preparation to be ready for handling it incidents




### Forencsic versus incident response
**Forensic**
- collect, examine and anlyze data
- goal is understanding of breach, compromise or attack (with potential legal relevance)
**Incident response**
- find out what has happened: goal is to recover from threat
- (usually) performed on a live system
- a lot faster than forensics
> often only live response is done

## Varia




**terms** 
- EDR: endpoint detection response
- Nonrepudiation: one cannot successfully dispute action, authorship or validity (Nachweisbarkeit)
- retention times: for how long can we keep information before we are forced to release/publish (from a legal perspective)
