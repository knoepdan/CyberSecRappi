# Android Malware BlackRoseLucy
### Steps

**1. Download and unpack BlackRoseLucy.apk**
- Download and rename to "BlackRoseLucy.apk"
- `apktool d BlackRoseLucy.apk` -> unpack 
- `jadx-gui` and check decompiled code
  - *Remark: had to set path to the $path variable again*

**2. Analyze code**

Check starting points from Androidmanifest.xml
- com.android.MainActivity
- com.android.Monitor
    - "App.getInstance().getServer();"
- android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService 
- com.android.AdminActivity -> no connection is being established

Some code snippets (class names) that send/receive over the network 
- com.android.Interceptors   -> not a candidate for C&C server
- Monitor.register -> probably not
- App -> https://thelucy.top/  (is also called by Monitor)

Probably flow
- Monitor.onCreate
  - Monitor.createServerBridge (which will call https://thelucy.top) -> will set variable mServer
  - StartMainCode
    - will schedule with fixed delay and periodically call getTasks which will request commands/etc from C&C server


C&C server: "https://thelucy.top/"
