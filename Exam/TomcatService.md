- explain different approaches and strategies how to run your own code on the server (PDF)
    - I imagine it is possible to upload a file that is then interpreted as application which runs on the server side. So the steps would be
        1. Upload file that contains server side code that gets the value of flat.txt and then prints it out as html
        2. Call the page we just uploaded to run the code -> this way we get the flag
        (havent found an entry point to do this.. would be a lucky punch)
- explain how you were able to get the flag from the server from /flag.txt
