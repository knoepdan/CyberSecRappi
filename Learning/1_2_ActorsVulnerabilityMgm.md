# Vulnerability

Phases
1. Discovery
2. Exploit  -> a "secret" exploit is available
3. Disclosure
4. Patch Release
5. Patch Installation

There is usually a timespan between knowledge about vulnerability and patch being installed. Hackers can use this to wait and exploit (provided they have managed to infect a host)



### Classification Vulnerabilities (Standards)
- CVE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures  (managed by MITRE)
    - Specific vulnerabilities (product related)
    - request CVE via https://www.cve.org/ (or https://cve.mitre.org) 
    - process see powerpoint + docment in github repo 
    - CVSS3 score
        - CVSS2 score is obsolete, stopped mid 2022
    - CVE Entry of a vulnerability will be assigned a CVSS3 score and a CWE
        - examples: https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2014-0160/ heartbleed, https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44832 log4J
    - List of exploits: https://www.exploit-db.com/  (exploits usually have a CWE)
- CWE  Common Weakness Enumeration  (also managed by MITRE)
    - classification of weaknesses (usually not directly product related): example cross-site scripting
    - https://www.cvedetails.com/cwe-definitions.php
- ASVS Application Security Verification Standard
    - intended mainly for developers (managed by OWASP)
    - ASVS -> basically a list of recommendations
        - ASVS level 1: recommendation for all apps (example: encoding)
        - ASVS level 2: 
        - ASVS level 3: for high security applications (e.g. nuclear plant)
    - https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/ main page
        - https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_4.0-en.pdf  (example)
 

*Some other definition: CVE is a standard for identifying and naming specific vulnerabilities, while CWE is a standard for classifying and describing the types of weaknesses that can lead to vulnerabilities*

**Vulnerability databases** usually (always?) have CVE assigned
- https://nvd.nist.gov/
- https://www.cvedetails.com/
- https://www.exploit-db.com/
- https://cve.mitre.org/  (again)

**OWASP TOP 10**
https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/
  - lists 10 most commen vulnerabilities (not the same as ASVS but both are managed by )
