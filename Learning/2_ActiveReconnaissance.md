# Active Reconnaissance

Some basics (supported by NMAP)
- Host Discovery > get hosts within a network
- Port Scanning > which ports are open
- Service detection
    - well-known ports (1-1023) and registered ports (1024-49151) are assigned to specific applications. However, ports can be arbitrarily assiged. 
    - tested by sending payload and then parsing responses
- OS Detection
- Vulnerability scanning
    - NMAP is also a small vulnerability scanner but there are better tools.. like Nessus
