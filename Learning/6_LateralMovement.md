## 1. NTLM Authzentication and Abuse
NTLM serves to provide authentication, integrity and confidentiality. Even though dated (using MD4), it is still available in modern windows and is used when: standalone server is not domain joined, kerberos is not supported, ip address is used, DNS fails. In practice it is hardly ever possible to disable NTLM.
