# Notes 11.5.2023

grey entries + 2

- entry+2 means we jump somewhere which is not possible

- Clear Code bytes


analysis -> all open


good idea: Patch with NOP instructions or direct jumps (if we know we only)


Finally export as Ghidra zip file

*Empty return*
```
CALL FUNj_XXX()
LABEL FUN_XXX
ADD qword ptr [RSP],  0x6 ; we manipulate the stack pointer
RET
```


### Debugging with exceptions

1. We register an unhandled exception handler which is only called when we NO debugger is attached. This exception handler changes the Instruction pointer so the program continues.   (with debugger, end up in the normal exception handling code)
