# Analyze sample1.doc file

**Quick answers**

- What does it do?
- What steps does it take to do it?


## Steps

### Extract vb code and getting info using tools
- run olevba to get a quick overview and extract code
    -  `pipenv run olevba ./Sample1.doc` to extract vb code from doc file
    - Some info: 
        - runs automatically upon opening
        - is suspicious: might run an executable, various attempts to obfuscate detected
- run ViperMonkey
    - `./docker/dockermonkey.sh ~/reversing/Sample.doc` 
        - Deobfuscation did not work that well (or I did something wrong)
        - However, a shell command was extracted, which itself is obfuscated
