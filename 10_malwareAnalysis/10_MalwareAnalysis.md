## Identifying malware

**YARA rules**
describes markers of malware (as usually a simple hash is easily bypassed, just changing a byte in the data section)

Some rule excerpts examples: 
-  {68 [-3] 07 ...}     -> means between 68 and 07 can be 0 or 3 bytes
- { 00 [1-5]FF ...}
- and for any i in (1 .. #a3)         ->   will loop through all occurences of variabel $a3
- and for any i in (1 .. -#a3): (uint8(@a3[i] + 2) == uint8(@a3[i] + 5))
    - @a3[i]  -> occurence in loop
    - @a3[i] + 2 -> points to 3 byte (which means it has to be variable like ??)
- and !a4 > 10   -> variable $a4 needs to be at least 11 bytes (! is for lenght) 

- $mz at 0     -> must be at the beginning
- uint32(uint32(0x3C)) == 0x00004550   -> at memory address 0x3C is a pointer to another memory address that has to have the value  0x00004550




## Varia

**size**
- Kib -> 1000 bytes
- KB -> 1024 bytes
